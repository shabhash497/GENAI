However, based on overall impact, records, and influence on the game, here\\'s my list of the top five cricketers of all time, acknowledging that others could easily be included:\\n\\n1.  **Sir Donald Bradman (Australia):**  This is almost universally accepted. His Test batting average of 99.94 is statistically far and away ahead of anyone else. His dominance was unparalleled, and his impact on the sport is legendary.\\n\\n2.  **Sachin Tendulkar (India):**  The \"God of Cricket.\"  He holds nearly every major batting record in both Test and ODI cricket.  His longevity, consistency, and the sheer weight of expectations he carried for a billion-plus people make him an icon.\\n\\n3.  **Sir Garfield Sobers (West Indies):**  A true all-rounder.  Sobers was a brilliant batsman (averaging 57.78 in Tests), a useful bowler (able to bowl pace, spin, and chinaman), and an exceptional fielder. Many consider him the greatest all-rounder of all time.\\n\\n4.  **Shane Warne (Australia):** Arguably the greatest leg-spinner of all time. Warne revived the art of leg-spin in an era dominated by pace. His impact on the game was immense, and he took over 700 Test wickets with his mesmerizing skill and tactical brilliance.\\n\\n5.  **Muttiah Muralitharan (Sri Lanka):** The highest wicket-taker in both Test and ODI cricket. While his action was controversial, his sheer volume of wickets and his ability to spin the ball prodigiously make him a strong contender for a top spot.\\n\\n**Important Considerations:**\\n\\n*   **Different Eras:** Comparing players across different eras is difficult due to changes in rules, pitches, equipment, and opposition.\\n*   **Subjectivity:**  Batting vs. bowling, Test vs. ODI performance, individual brilliance vs. team success all play a role.\\n*   **Omissions:**  Many other greats could easily be on this list, including  Jacques Kallis, Wasim Akram, Viv Richards, Imran Khan, and many others.
